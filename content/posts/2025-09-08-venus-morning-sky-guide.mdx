Catching **Venus** is easy if you know when and where to look.

- **When:** 1 hour before sunrise, best between **05:30–06:30** local time.
- **Where:** Low in the **east-northeast**; find a clear horizon.
- **How:** Try **7×50** binoculars to punch through twilight. A smartphone planetarium app helps with bearings.
