Scientists using the **James Webb Space Telescope** have reported a clear methane signal on a warm Neptune-sized exoplanet. The detection adds weight to theories that such worlds host complex carbon chemistry.

### Why it matters
- Methane points to processes that shape atmospheric composition.
- Helps benchmark models for Neptune-class worlds.
- Guides target lists for future high-resolution follow-ups.

> The team notes that clouds and hazes still complicate spectra — but longer integrations should sharpen the picture.
